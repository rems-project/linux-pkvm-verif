================

This is a private copy of the Android Linux repo <https://android-kvm.googlesource.com/linux> for experimentation with pKVM verification.

Contact Peter Sewell to add access.

We have notes:

from Will and Andrew S., explaining how to get, build, and run the pKVM code.

- [notes37-2020-11-25-pkvm-code-overview](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/Stuff/pkvm/notes37-2020-11-25-pkvm-code-overview.html),
describing the code and the initialisation sequence.



Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
